# How to Obtain Public Traffic Signal Timing and Phase Data (ASTPM) in Salt Lake City, Utah

In car crash cases—especially those involving intersection liability—knowing the **exact sequence and duration of traffic signals** is crucial. Utah maintains a robust, public-facing Advanced Signal Performance Metrics (ASTPM) system that logs real-time signal phase data across hundreds of intersections, including Salt Lake City.

This guide teaches you exactly how to locate and obtain traffic light timing data using public tools and state-level records.

## Key Resource

**Advanced Signal Performance Metrics (ASTPM)**  
Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)  
Hosted via: [https://udottraffic.utah.gov/](https://udottraffic.utah.gov/)

ASTPM is UDOT’s platform for collecting, analyzing, and displaying real-time and historical signal performance data. It logs:

- Signal phase and duration
- Vehicle detection events
- Split failures
- Green/red/yellow intervals
- Time-of-day pattern changes

## Step-by-Step: How to Obtain Traffic Light Data

### Step 1: Identify the Exact Intersection

- Use the crash report, dashcam footage, or Google Maps to identify:
  - **Street names**
  - **Direction of travel**
  - **Cross streets**
  - **Closest milepost or intersection number (if available)**

Example: "700 E and 2100 S, Salt Lake City, UT"

---

### Step 2: Access UDOT’s ASTPM Portal

1. Visit: [https://udottraffic.utah.gov](https://udottraffic.utah.gov)
2. Click on the **“Performance Metrics”** tab at the top
3. Choose **“ASTPM Portal”** (You may be redirected to an Esri or Traffop dashboard)

---

### Step 3: Search for Your Intersection

- Use the **map view** or **intersection dropdown** (depending on interface)
- Filter by:
  - Date and time of crash
  - Direction of traffic
  - Signal ID or intersection name

> If you're unable to locate the intersection, contact UDOT Traffic Operations Center (TOC):  
>  (801) 887-3700  
>  askudot@utah.gov

### Step 4: Export the Data

Once the signal is located:
- Choose **“Phase Termination”** or **“Split Monitor”**
- Set:
  - **Date and time range** around the crash (e.g., ±1 hour)
  - **Approach or direction** (e.g., NB, EB, WB, SB)
- Click **“Export CSV”** or **“Download Report”**

This provides a precise timeline of light sequences (green, yellow, red) and phase terminations.

### Step 5: Use in Legal or Insurance Context

You or your attorney can:
- Match the signal phase to the exact crash timestamp
- Determine if the left-turning driver had a protected or permissive light
- Prove you entered the intersection on a green
- Identify pattern anomalies (e.g., early red)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this data admissible in court?**  
Yes. As a public record from a government system, it is generally admissible under Utah Rules of Evidence 902(5) or 1005. You may need an affidavit or TOC witness for authentication.

**Q: How accurate is the timestamp data?**  
UDOT ASTPM systems are synced via NTP (network time protocol) and are considered reliable within 0.1 seconds.

**Q: Can I request older signal logs?**  
Yes. UDOT retains historic signal data. For records over 30 days old, submit a **GRAMA Request** through:
[https://openrecords.utah.gov](https://openrecords.utah.gov)

Use request title:  
> "ASTPM Signal Data for [Intersection] on [Date and Time Range]"

**Q: What if my intersection isn’t listed?**  
Not all signals are wired for ASTPM. In that case, submit a manual request to UDOT TOC or SLC Transportation:
 Salt Lake City Transportation: (801) 535-6630
